This post summarizes:
- ✅ 10 practical lessons for investors extracted from Jenga’s data and case studies.
- 🌐 The 10 official lessons on global outperformance (from pages 256–268 of the report).

## 🔑 10 Lessons for Investors from the Global Outperformers Dataset

### 1. **Start with Profitability**
82% of ten-baggers were already profitable at the start of their run.
- 📌 *Example*: MSCI had strong operating metrics and was spun off from Morgan Stanley.

### 2. **Margin Expansion Beats Revenue Growth**
Higher profit margins (EBIT) were more critical than just sales growth.
- 📌 *Example*: Airports of Thailand raised margins from 30% to 55%.

### 3. **Small Caps, Big Wins**
63% of outperformers started as nano caps (<$50M).
- 📌 *Example*: Celsius Holdings exploded from a microcap to a beverage giant.

### 4. **High Multiples Can Still Outperform**
If growth justifies valuation, even high-multiple stocks can succeed.
- 📌 *Example*: Amazon had 112x EV/EBIT in 2012, yet compounded earnings at 39% CAGR.

### 5. **Winners Aren’t All in Tech**
Industrials and materials outperformed popular consumer/IT sectors.
- 📌 *Example*: Ganfeng Lithium capitalized on EV demand to soar 2,749%.

### 6. **Founders Matter**
Founder-led or high-insider-ownership companies performed better.
- 📌 *Example*: ANTA Sports grew from regional brand to global leader under founder vision.

### 7. **Geography Shapes Opportunity**
India, Israel, Sweden, and Japan consistently outperformed expectations.
- 📌 *Example*: Sweden contributed 20 outperformers despite a small domestic market.

### 8. **Turnarounds Can Be Gold**
Struggling firms that fixed operations yielded stellar returns.
- 📌 *Example*: Adobe and Trex rebounded via strategic pivots.

### 9. **Moats Drive Multiple Expansion**
Improving profitability and widening moats led to valuation gains.
- 📌 *Example*: Lasertec tripled margins and became critical to chip production.

### 10. **Don't Chase Past Winners**
Only 5% of previous ten-baggers repeated. Use insights, not tickers.
- 📌 *Example*: Focus on traits of companies, not historical stock charts.

## 🌐 Ten Lessons on Global Outperformance (From Report Pages 256–268)

### 1. **Open-Mindedness and Flexibility**
Outperformance can come from anywhere—any geography, sector, or strategy.
- 📌 *Example*: Ignoring industrials or materials would've missed ~40% of winners.

### 2. **The Future Is Asia**
59% of outperformers came from Asia, yet global funds under-allocate there.
- 📌 *Example*: India and Thailand produced top compounders like ANTA Sports and Airports of Thailand.

### 3. **Thematic Investing Requires Discipline**
Themes (e.g., AI, EVs, sustainability) can be useful, but need strong fundamentals.
- 📌 *Example*: Many clean energy names underperformed due to poor economics.

### 4. **Value Chain Investing**
Investors who understand how value flows across ecosystems often find overlooked gems.
- 📌 *Example*: Following solar demand led investors to winners in lithium, inverters, and energy storage.

### 5. **Valuation Still Matters**
Great businesses can disappoint if bought at unreasonable prices.
- 📌 *Example*: *Hypoport*, *Benefit One* fell over 60% after peaking at excessive EV/EBIT multiples.

### 6. **Think Long-Term**
Outperformance takes time. Many top stocks underperformed early.
- 📌 *Example*: Netflix and NVIDIA didn’t take off for years after public listing.

### 7. **Cyclicals Can Be Compounders**
Cyclical firms in industries like semiconductors delivered top returns.
- 📌 *Example*: Lasertec and Micron rebounded strongly after down cycles.

### 8. **Back the Right Operators**
Founders and high-skin-in-the-game leaders tend to outperform.
- 📌 *Example*: Tesla, ANTA, and Phat Dat were founder-led and mission-driven.

### 9. **Imagination Is a Competitive Edge**
Top investors connect dots across sectors, value chains, and geographies.
- 📌 *Example*: Seeing EV trends led to upstream investments in lithium and chipmakers.

### 10. **Turn Over New Rocks**
Most past outperformers don’t repeat—seek new edges continuously.
- 📌 *Example*: Companies like Vitec Software or Relaxo Footwear were small, ignored winners a decade ago.
